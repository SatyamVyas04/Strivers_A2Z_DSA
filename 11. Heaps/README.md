# Overview

## 11.1. Learning

Heap, implemented using heapq in Python, is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a min-heap, for any given node, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children, ensuring that the smallest element is always at the root. Conversely, in a max-heap, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, placing the largest element at the root. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements with higher priority are served before those with lower priority. They are also utilized in various algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and heap sort.

## 11.2. Medium Problems

Good problems like finding the k-th largest element, merging k sorted lists, and task scheduling are covered in this section to help you understand the practical applications of heaps.

## 11.3. Hard Problems

This included Design Twitter, Median Stream, and Min Ropes problems, which require a deeper understanding of heap operations and optimizations.
