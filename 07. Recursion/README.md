# Overview

## 7.1. Strong Hold

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. Here are some key concepts and examples related to recursion:

## 7.2. Subsequences

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "abc", "abg", "bdf" are subsequences of "abcdefg". Many problems can be solved using recursion by exploring all possible subsequences of a given sequence.

## 7.3. Hard Problems

Some problems are inherently complex and require advanced recursive techniques to solve. These problems often involve exploring multiple paths or combinations, and recursion can help manage the complexity by breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts.
