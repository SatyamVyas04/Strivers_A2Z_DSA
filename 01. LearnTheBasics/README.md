# Overview

## 1.1. Things to know about any language

Pretty basic stuff like user i/o, datatypes, if else, switch, loops, arrays, strings, while, for, functions, pass by ref and pass by val, basics of time complexity and space complexity.

Major learning during this phase came from my school days, where I learnt a lot of these concepts in Python. I also did a lot of practice on competitive programming platforms like CodeChef, CodeForces, LeetCode etc.

## 1.2. Build up Logical Thinking

Did these pattern problems in Semester 1, didn't know why I was doing them back then, but now I know that they were helping me build up logical thinking. But didn't add them here because they are very basic.

## 1.3. STL/Collections

For someone that codes in Python, I'd recommend learning these standard Python libraries that are useful

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html

## 1.4. Basic Maths

Stuff like LCM, HCF, Prime Numbers, Sieve of Eratosthenes, GCD, Modular Arithmetic, Exponentiation by Squaring etc.

## 1.5. Learning Basic Recursion

This is a very important topic, and I would recommend learning it in great detail. Helps build up on these concepts:

- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Divide and Conquer
- Even trees and their traversals

Did a fair share of these problems in my college course of Data Structures and Algorithms, and also on competitive programming platforms like CodeChef, CodeForces, LeetCode etc.

## 1.6. Learn Basic Hashing

If you're from CS background, you might have already done this in your college course of Data Structures and Algorithms. If not, then I would recommend learning it from these resources:

## That's all :)
