# Overview

## 5.1. Basic Problems

Bhai kaafi basic stuff, like reverse, anagram check, palindrome check. Pretty neat and simple.

## 5.2. Medium Problems

Medium problems included Roman number to integer, ATOI, still nothing that wasn't tough to understand, just implementation heavy. And anyways, strings are the easiest to implement using Python.

## That's all :)
