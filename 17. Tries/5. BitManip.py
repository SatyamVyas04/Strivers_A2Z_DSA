Bit Manipulation for Tries

1. Storage: Indexing of a 32 bit number, suppose, will go from 0 to 31, from right to left.
2. XOR: XOR of two numbers will give 1 if the bits are different, 0 if the bits are same. Or, even ones gives a 0, odd ones gives a 1.
3. AND: AND of two numbers will give 1 if both the bits are 1, 0 otherwise.
4. Right and Left Shift: Right shift by 1 is equivalent to dividing by 2, left shift by 1 is equivalent to multiplying by 2.
5. Turn on the nth bit: OR with 1 << n.
