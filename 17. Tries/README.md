# Overview

## Tries

A Trie (pronounced as "try") is a special type of tree used to store associative data structures. The name "Trie" comes from the word "retrieval." It is particularly useful for storing strings, where each node represents a character of a string. The root node represents an empty string, and each path from the root to a leaf node represents a complete string. Tries are commonly used for tasks such as autocomplete, spell checking, and prefix matching.
