# A spanning tree is a tree in which we have N nodes(i.e. All the nodes present in the original graph) and N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other.

# Among all possible spanning trees of a graph, the minimum spanning tree is the one for which the sum of all the edge weights is the minimum.
