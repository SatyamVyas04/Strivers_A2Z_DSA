# Overview

## 4.1. Binary Search 1D

Standard problems like finding an element in a sorted array, finding first and last occurrence of an element in a sorted array, finding the number of occurrences of an element in a sorted array, finding the square root of a number, finding the peak element in an array, etc. These are some of the most common problems that can be solved using binary search. Loved solving these problems.

## 4.2. Binary Search on Answer

These are some advanced problems that can be solved using binary search on the answer. Problems like Aggressive cows, Painter's partition problem, Koko eating bananas, etc. These problems require a different approach to binary search and are very interesting to solve. Enjoyed solving these problems a lot. These are VERY important problems and are frequently asked in interviews.

## 4.3. Search in 2D Matrix

Problems like Peak element in a 2D matrix, searching an element in a 2D matrix, etc. These problems require a different approach to binary search and are very interesting to solve. Enjoyed solving these problems a lot. These are greattt for building intuition of binary search in 2D matrices.
