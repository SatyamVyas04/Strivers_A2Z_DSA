# Overview

## 3.1. Easy

Very basic problems on arrays. like finding max, min, sum, average, etc. Basically problems which can be solved in a single traversal of the array. I did skip these doing max(), min() functions of python, idk man why xd. Some problems towards the end, that included prefix sums were fun to solve.

## 3.2. Medium

Standard problems like TwoSum, Kadane's, best time to buy and sell stock, etc. I did solve these problems before but it was fun solving them again. Some problems like Next Permutation, Longest Consecutive Sequence, Set Matrix Zeroes, Rotate Matrix, Spiral Matrix, Count of Subarrays with Sum K were new to me and I enjoyed solving them. Loved it a lot.

## 3.3. Hard

Struggled a bit with these problems back then, but just revised them and solved them again. Problems like Merge Overlapping Intervals, and Maximum Product Subarray were fun to solve again. The Repeating and Missing Number problem is a personal favorite, as a Math lover. Overall, a great experience revisiting these problems.
