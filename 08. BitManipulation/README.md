# Overview

## 8.1. Basics

Basic bit manipulation operations and concepts included bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, right shift, and masking techniques. These operations are fundamental for low-level programming, optimizing performance, and solving problems related to binary representations of data.

## 8.2. Interview specific problems

Flip bits, subsequences, missing number using xor, as some standard patterns in bit manipulation problems. These are not that easy to spot at first, but once you get the hang of it, you can solve a lot of problems using these patterns.

## 8.3. Hard problems

Sieve of Eratosthenes, is the key takeaway from this section. It is a classic algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer.
