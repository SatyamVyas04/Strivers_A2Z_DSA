# Overview

## 12.1. Basic Problems

Learnt Fractional Knapsack and basic coin change problems here, which are the foundation of greedy algorithms. The message is clear - make the locally optimal choice at each step, and you'll reach the global optimum. Chhota fayda dekho aur bada nuksan mat karo.

## 12.2. Medium/Hard Problems

Here, I tackled more complex problems like N Meetings, Job Scheduling, and Merge Intervals. These problems required a deeper understanding of greedy strategies and how to apply them effectively. The key takeaway is that greedy algorithms can be powerful, but they need to be applied judiciously.

> Fix your mind on Me alone, surrender your intellect to Me. Thus you shall dwell in Me always—there is no doubt. This verse captures the essence of loving devotion (bhakti) as the direct route to the Divine.
