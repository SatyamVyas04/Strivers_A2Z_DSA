# Overview

## 2.1. Sorting - I

- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort

Pretty straightforward sorting algorithms. These are not used in production code but are important to understand the basic concepts of sorting. Did these in-place and stable sorting algorithms.

No better resource than [Striver's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGk_ypEuS24) to understand these algorithms.

## 2.2. Sorting - II

- [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogjf7ORKfd8)
- Recursive Bubble Sort
- Recursive Insertion Sort
- [Quick Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIrA4YexLRQ)

These are more advanced sorting algorithms. Merge Sort and Quick Sort are widely used in practice. Merge Sort is stable but not in-place, while Quick Sort is in-place but not stable. Understanding these algorithms is crucial for efficient sorting in various applications.
