# Overview

## 13.1. Traversals

Learnt what a binary tree is. Learnt about different types of traversals - inorder, preorder, postorder, level order. Implemented all of them using both recursive and iterative approaches. This was done during my CS course at university. Pretty straightforward. One of my favourite topics.

## 13.2. Medium

Problems like top view, bottom view, left view, right view of a binary tree. Vertical order traversal. Diagonal traversal. Boundary traversal. Implemented all of them. Learnt about horizontal distance and vertical levels in a binary tree.

## 13.3. Hard

Problems like flattening a binary tree to a linked list, populating next right pointers in each node, constructing binary tree from inorder and preorder/postorder traversals, finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree, finding the maximum path sum in a binary tree. Implemented all of them. Learnt about Morris Traversal for inorder traversal without recursion and without stack. These were quite challenging problems but I enjoyed solving them.
