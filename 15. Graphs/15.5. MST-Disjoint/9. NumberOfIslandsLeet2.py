# Problem: Basically number of islands problem, but with a twist. We have to find the number of islands in a 2D grid, where 1 represents land and 0 represents water, At each other and at each iteration a new piece of land is added at [i][j] and we have to find the number of islands after each iteration. So each iterations shapes the islands differently.

# This seems a lot like a Union Find problem, where we union the newly added piece of land to the existing land and then find the number of islands.

# Premium problem, could't really solve it. That's all for now.
